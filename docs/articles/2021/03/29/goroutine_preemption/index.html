<p>I was looking into the preemption of goroutine in Go. It would be appreciatee if you could point out any mistakes and tell me it.</p>

<p>The behavior of preemption in Go changed at Go1.14 release.
On Go1.14, goroutine is &ldquo;asynchronously preemptible&rdquo; as described in <a href="https://golang.org/doc/go1.14#runtime">Release Notes</a>. What does this mean?</p>

<p>First, let&rsquo;s look at a simple example.
Consider the following Go program.</p>

<pre><code class="language-go">package main

import (
	&quot;fmt&quot;
)

func main() {
	go fmt.Println(&quot;hi&quot;)
	for {
	}
}

</code></pre>

<p>In the main function, it starts one goroutine that just outputs &ldquo;hi&rdquo;. In addition, it loops infinitely with <code>for {}</code>.</p>

<p>What will happen if we run this program with <code>GOMAXPROCS=1</code>? It seems to output &ldquo;hi&rdquo; and then nothing happens because of the infinite loop.
In fact, when I run this program on Go1.14 or later (I ran it on Go1.16 (on Ubuntu on WSL2)), it works as it should.</p>

<p>There are two ways to prevent this program from running as it should. One is to run it with a version of Go earlier than 1.14. The other is to run it with <code>GODEBUG=asyncpreemptoff=1</code>.</p>

<p>When I tried it in local machine, it worked as follows.</p>

<pre><code>$ GOMAXPROCS=1 GODEBUG=asyncpreemptoff=1 go run main.go
# it blocks here
</code></pre>

<p>No &ldquo;hi&rdquo; is output. Before describing why this happens, let me explain a couple of ways to make this program behave as expected.</p>

<p>One way is to add the following process in the loop.</p>

<pre><code>*** main.go.org	2021-03-26 20:03:16.840000000 +0900
--- main2.go	2021-03-26 20:03:58.970000000 +0900
*************** package main
*** 2,11 ****
--- 2,13 ----
  
  import (
  	&quot;fmt&quot;
+ 	&quot;runtime&quot;
  )
  
  func main() {
  	go fmt.Println(&quot;hi&quot;)
  	for {
+ 		runtime.Gosched()
  	}
  }

</code></pre>

<p><code>runtime.Gosched()</code> is something like POSIX&rsquo;s <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/sched_yield.2.html"><code>sched_yield</code></a>, where <code>sched_yield</code> forces the thread to give up CPU so that other threads can run.
It is named <code>Gosched</code> because Go is a goroutine, not a thread (this is a guess).
In other words, explicitly calling <code>runtime.Gosched()</code> will force the goroutines to be rescheduled, and we can expect the current-running-goroutine is switched to another one.</p>

<p>Another way is using <a href="https://github.com/golang/go/blob/87a3ac5f5328ea0a6169cfc44bdb081014fcd3ec/src/cmd/internal/objabi/util.go#L257">GOEXPERIMENT=preemptibleloops</a>. It forces the Go runtime to do the preemption on the &ldquo;loop&rdquo;. The way doesn&rsquo;t require the code change.</p>

  </a>Cooperative vs. Preemptive scheduling in Go</h2>

<p>To begin with, there are two main methods for scheduling multitasking; &ldquo;Cooperative&rdquo; and &ldquo;Preemptive&rdquo;. Cooperative multitasking is also called &ldquo;non-preemptive&rdquo;.
In cooperative multitasking, how the program switches depends on the program itself. It seems that the term &ldquo;cooperative&rdquo; is intended to refer to the fact that the programs should be designed to be interoperable and they must &ldquo;cooperate&rdquo; each other.
In preemptive multitasking, the switch of the program is left to the OS. The scheduling method is based on some algorithm, such as priority-based, FCSV, round-robin, etc.</p>

<p>So now, is the scheduling of goroutine cooperative or preemptive?
At least up to Go1.13, it was cooperative.</p>

<p>I couldn&rsquo;t find any official documentation, but I found out that goroutine switches happen in the following cases (this is not exhaustive.) ;</p>

<ul>
<li>Waiting to read or write to an unbuffered channel</li>
<li>Waiting due to system call invocation</li>
<li>Waiting because of time.Sleep()</li>
<li>Waiting for mutex to be released</li>
</ul>

<p>In addition, Go has a component that keeps executing a function called &ldquo;sysmon&rdquo;, which does preemption (and other things like making the waiting state of network processing non-blocking).
The sysmon component is M (Machine, it is actually an OS thread), but it runs without P (Processor). The term M, P and G is explained in various articles like <a href="https://developpaper.com/gmp-principle-and-scheduling-analysis-of-golang-scheduler/">this</a>. I recommend that you refer to such articles if needed.</p>

<p>When sysmon finds that M has been running the same G (Goroutine) for more than 10ms, it sets the <code>preempt</code> flag, an internal parameter of that G, to true. Then, in the function prologue when the G makes a function call, the G checks its own <code>preempt</code> flag, and if it is true, it detaches itself from M and pushes itself to a queue called &ldquo;global queue&rdquo;. Now, the preemption is done successfully.
By the way, the global queue is a different queue from the &ldquo;local queue&rdquo;, a queue to store G that P has. There are several purposes of a global queue.</p>

<ul>
<li>To store Gs that exceed the capacity (256) of local queue.</li>
<li>To store Gs that are waiting for various reasons.</li>
<li>To store Gs that are detached by the preempt flag.</li>
</ul>

<p>This is the implementation up to Go1.13. Now, you&rsquo;ll understand why the infinite looping code above did not work as expected. The <code>for {}</code> is just a busy loop, so it does not trigger the goroutine switch as described earlier. You may think, &ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t the preempt flag set by sysmon because it has been running for more than 10ms?&rdquo; However, <strong>if there is no function call, even if the preempt flag is set, the check of the flag does not occur</strong>. As I mentioned earlier, the check of the preempt flag occurs in function prologue, so a busy loop with doing nothing could not reach the execution of preemption.</p>

<p>And yes, this behavior has changed with the introduction of &ldquo;non-cooperative preemption&rdquo; (asynchronous preemption) in Go1.14.</p>

  </a>What does &ldquo;asynchronously preemptible&rdquo; mean?</h2>

<p>Let&rsquo;s summarize the points so far; Go has a mechanism, called &ldquo;sysmon&rdquo;, to monitor goroutines running for more than 10ms and force preemption when necessary. However, due to the way it worked, preemption did not occur in cases like <code>for {}</code>.</p>

<p>With the non-cooperative preemption introduced in Go1.14, the scheduler in Goroutine can now be called preemptive. It is a simple but effective algorithm that uses signals.</p>

<p>First, sysmon still detects a G (goroutine) that has been moving for more than 10ms. Then, sysmon sends a signal ( <code>SIGURG</code> ) to the thread (P) that is running that G.
Go&rsquo;s signal handler invokes another goroutine called <code>gsignal</code> on P to handle the signal, maps it to M instead of G, and makes it check the signal. The gsignal sees that preemption has been ordered and stops the G that was running until then.</p>

<p>Because this mechanism explicitly emits a signal, don&rsquo;t need to call a function in other words, just a goroutine which is running busy loop can be switched to another goroutine.</p>

<p>With this asynchronous preemption mechanism using signals, the above code now works as expected. <code>GODEBUG=asyncpreemptoff=1</code> can be used to disable the asynchronous preemption.</p>

<p>Incidentally, they chose to use SIGURG because SIGURG does not interfere with the use of existing debuggers and other signals, and because it is not used in libc.

  </a>Summary</h2>

<p>Just because an infinite loop that doesn&rsquo;t do anything doesn&rsquo;t pass holding CPU to other goroutines, it doesn&rsquo;t mean that the mechanism up to Go1.13 is bad. As <a href="https://github.com/golang/go/issues/11462#issuecomment-116616022">@davecheney</a> has said, this is usually not considered a particular problem. In the first place, asynchronous preemption was not introduced to solve this infinite loop problem.</p>

<p>Although the introduction of asynchronous preemption made scheduling more preemptive, it also made it necessary to be more careful in handling &ldquo;unsafe points&rdquo; during GC. The implementation considerations in this area are also very interesting. Readers who are interested can read it themselves <a href="https://github.com/golang/proposal/blob/master/design/24543-non- cooperative-preemption.md">Proposition: Non-cooperative goroutine preemption</a>.</p>
